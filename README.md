This is an OS project, obviously for learning.

Being perceived as a "soon-to-be" hardcore project for my CS self-learning pathway. This project is not orignal, in fact it's a tutorial project from https://os.phil-opp.com .

However there will be attempts to push the tutorial project further by implementing more "OS" features and learning new things that are not offered in the tutorial along the way.
