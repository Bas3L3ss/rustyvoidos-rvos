This is an operating system project created for learning purposes.

It is intended to become a more advanced project as part of my self-directed computer science learning path. The project itself is not original; it is based on the tutorial at https://os.phil-opp.com .

However, I plan to extend the tutorial by implementing additional OS features and exploring concepts beyond what the tutorial covers.
